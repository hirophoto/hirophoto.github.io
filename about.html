  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a Sydney-based photographer with experience as an in-house photographer capturing venue photos, 
    as well as working as a freelance photographer specialising in events, including baby showers, birthday celebrations, and weddings, 
    where I focus on delivering high-quality images that preserve every detail and emotion.
